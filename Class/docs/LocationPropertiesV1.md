## Example

```python
from openapi_client.models.location_properties_v1 import LocationPropertiesV1

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of LocationPropertiesV1 from a JSON string
location_properties_v1_instance = LocationPropertiesV1.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(LocationPropertiesV1.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
location_properties_v1_dict = location_properties_v1_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of LocationPropertiesV1 from a dict
location_properties_v1_from_dict = LocationPropertiesV1.from_dict(location_properties_v1_dict)
